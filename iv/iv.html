                <p>
                    As you know from my CV. I'm a front-end engineer with more than 4 years of experience. And now I'm located in Germany. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my FE career from <strong>CrispWP</strong> company <=  they specialised in WP (content management system (CMS)) projects and => 
                    we created unique sites and projects, as part of the development team I often had to communicate with the client and 
                    designers to quickly discuss new features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My next company was <strong>Mabbli</strong>, it was similar to CrispWP, but sometimes we came across projects using react (I met React in this company)
                    Throughout the time I improved my knowledge and then I realised that I want to learn more about React - I began to study react, 
                    typescript and so on, now I work on a project using all these skills and continue to learn something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>after moving to Germany</strong>  I got a job in <strong>Bleech</strong> company almost from the first month when I came in G. 
                    Like my previous company they specialised in WP projects, as part of the development team I also communicate with 
                    the client and designers to quickly discuss new features. <br/>
                    But after NY company has some problems, day by day there were fewer customers, 
                    the entire team was transferred to support, after a while the company fired 10 out of 30 employees. 
                    But for me it was a very good start to improving my skills as a React developer, and then I found a project at the university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    most of the time I worked for outsourcing companies and had many projects with unique tasks ranging from implementing 
                    exciting animations to creating logically functionalities
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'm working in <strong>Dresden University</strong> As a frontend developer. We provide a collection of simple tools for groundwater flow 
                    simulation. <span style="color: brown;"> Last week I worked with Unit-Test for our components and in this sprint I need to implement a 3D chart for some tools.</span>

                    My typical working day starts by checking my tasks. Then, my team and I have a quick 
                    15-minute meeting where we discuss what everyone is doing, plans for the day, and 
                    any issues. After that, I focus on my main tasks. Sometimes, I have extra meetings 
                    for projects or calls with clients and designers to talk about specific tasks.

                        As for moving, this is not a problem, but we must understand that it can
                        cause (trigger) some discomfort. First, I live with my family, my 
                        daughter goes to a local school. It may take some time - finding an apartment, 
                        a new school, etc. So we can come back to this later at least after a trial
                        period, when we are confident in each other and in our long-term partnership

                        The main thing in remote work is effective communication. When team members are not 
                        physically present in the same location the main thing is clear and transparent 
                        communication. This includes regular updates on progress, sharing information about 
                        tasks, and ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding goals and expectations.

                        COVID teaches us to work remotely - I have been working remotely for 2 years now and it is absolutely fine for me.

                        using tools like EasyRedmine, Trello, Confluence, Asana, GitHub, GitLab, and CI/CD for effective communication and 
                        coordination.

                        Typically ranging of my team from 2 to 10 members, including project managers, QA teams, 
                        backend, and frontend developers. As a frontend developer, my responsibilities span the

                    Well, while my CV showcases my professional way and skills, it might not show my passion for 
                    working on personal projects, like creating fun apps for my child. Also, I love traveling. 
                    Playing board games, sometimes playing on PS. Also I love Snowboarding. I haven't been 
                    snowboarding lately, but I hope to fix that this year.

                    I love creating things and watching them grow. This principle aims to show what we have done quickly and often.
                     This is important to me because the interface where the visual effects and animations happen is magic. 
                     But now I have started a detailed study of Node.js and databases, and I believe that there is also its own magic.

                    As a developer working in outsourced companies with a large number of projects, 
                    I learned to quickly switch between projects and tasks. So I think it is - 
                    adaptability. Adaptability is the most impactful lesson in my coding career. 
                    It enables me to quickly learn new technologies working with a huge amount of tasks.

                    If I find an issue in a teammate's code during a pull request review, my primary approach is 
                    to initiate a discussion directly with them. I believe open communication is key to resolving
                     such situations effectively. Collaborative resolution, where both parties understand and 
                     learn from the mistake, is key to maintaining a positive and productive team dynamic.
